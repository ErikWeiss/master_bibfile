	abstract = {Point defects in diamond known as nitrogen-vacancy centres have been shown to be sensitive to minute magnetic fields, even at room temperature. A demonstration that the spin associated with these defect centres is also sensitive to electric fields holds out the prospect of a sensor that can resolve, under ambient conditions, single spins and single elementary charges at the nanoscale.},
