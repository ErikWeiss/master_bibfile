	abstract = {Searching for new particles beyond the standard model is crucial for understanding several fundamental conundrums in physics and astrophysics. Amongst them, axions or similar hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons would mediate electron-nucleon interactions. While previous experiments set stringent upper bounds of this interaction strength with force range over \$20 {\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m, experimental searching at shorter force range remains elusive. We develop a method that utilizes a near-surface Nitrogen-vacancy center as a quantum sensor to explore such interaction. New constraints for axion-mediated electron-nucleon coupling, \$g\_s{\textasciicircum}Ng\_p{\textasciicircum}e\$, have been set for the force range \$0.1 \$--\$23{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m. The obtained upper bound of the interaction at \$20{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu\$m, \$g\_s{\textasciicircum}Ng\_p{\textasciicircum}e {\textless} 6.24{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$, is two orders of magnitude more stringent than that set by earlier experiments. Our method can be further extended to investigate other spin-dependent interactions and opens the door for the single-spin quantum sensor to explore new physics beyond the standard model.},
