	abstract = {Current algorithms for quantum state tomography (QST) are costly both on the experimental front, requiring measurement of many copies of the state, and on the classical computational front, needing a long time to analyze the gathered data. Here, we introduce neural adaptive quantum state tomography (NAQT), a fast, flexible machine-learning-based algorithm for QST that adapts measurements and provides orders of magnitude faster processing while retaining state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. As in other adaptive QST schemes, measurement adaptation makes use of the information gathered from previous measured copies of the state to perform a targeted sensing of the next copy, maximizing the information gathered from that next copy. Our NAQT approach allows for a rapid and seamless integration of measurement adaptation and statistical inference, using a neural-network replacement of the standard Bayes’ update, to obtain the best estimate of the state. Our algorithm, which falls into the machine learning subfield of “meta-learning” (in effect “learning to learn” about quantum states), does not require any ansatz about the form of the state to be estimated. Despite this generality, it can be retrained within hours on a single laptop for a two-qubit situation, which suggests a feasible time-cost when extended to larger systems and potential speed-ups if provided with additional structure, such as a state ansatz.},

	abstract = {The future development of quantum technologies relies on creating and manipulating quantum systems of increasing complexity, with key applications in computation, simulation and sensing. This poses severe challenges in the efficient control, calibration and validation of quantum states and their dynamics. Although the full simulation of large-scale quantum systems may only be possible on a quantum computer, classical characterization and optimization methods still play an important role. Here, we review different approaches that use classical post-processing techniques, possibly combined with adaptive optimization, to learn quantum systems, their correlation properties, dynamics and interaction with the environment. We discuss theoretical proposals and successful implementations across different multiple-qubit architectures such as spin qubits, trapped ions, photonic and atomic systems, and superconducting circuits. This Review provides a brief background of key concepts recurring across many of these approaches with special emphasis on the Bayesian formalism and neural networks.},
