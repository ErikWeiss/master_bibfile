	abstract = {We study possibilities of creation and detection of oscillating gravitational fields from lab-scale high energy, relativistic sources. The sources considered are high energy laser beams in an optical cavity and the ultra-relativistic proton bunches circulating in the beam of the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN. These sources allow for signal frequencies much higher and far narrower in bandwidth than what most celestial sources produce. In addition, by modulating the beams, one can adjust the source frequency over a very broad range, from Hz to GHz. The gravitational field of these sources and responses of a variety of detectors are analyzed. We optimize a mechanical oscillator such as a pendulum or torsion balance as detector and find parameter regimes such that—combined with the planned high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC as a source—a signal-to-noise ratio substantially larger than 1 should be achievable at least in principle, neglecting all sources of technical noise. This opens new perspectives of studying general relativistic effects and possibly quantum-gravitational effects with ultra-relativistic, well-controlled terrestrial sources.},
